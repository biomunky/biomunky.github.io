### what's in a name?

I've used the handle biomunky for years (20+). It's a name based on a combination of my fascination with biology and an old clothing brand I liked when I was a child - drunknmunky.

Today I don't do much biology and I'm fairly sure the clothing brand doesn't exist. 

> Note: there are other folks out there using the same handle - some of them are strange people.

### what have I done?

It feels like I've been working in the data space for a very long time.

My academic past covered biology, stats, programming and ML. Since then, I've worked in social media, video games, government and finance. I have helped build data platforms and products as well as build novel machine learning models and deploying them to production.

I've had roles as a software engineer, data engineer, ML engineer and Data Architect. I've worked as an IC, team lead and within cross-functional teams and most recently as the Head of Data and Analytics at a consultancy firm.

### what am I doing now?

I'm have recently returned to finance, working fulltime on deploying Generative AI as a core service.

### what do I like?

I'm really enjoying GenAI at the moment, seeing how it can help 'get things done'. In terms of programming, I like Python, Rust and Elixir but also mess about with Ocaml and various Lisps.
