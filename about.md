Over the last 15+ years I've been working around the data space.

My MSc and PhD involved biology, stats and ML. Subsequently, I've worked in media, video games, government and finance building data platforms and products.

I've had roles as a software engineer, data engineer, ML engineer and Data Architect. I've worked as an IC, team lead and within cross-functional teams.

I'm currently the Data & Analytics Practice Lead / Head of Data & Analytics Engineering at a boutique Software Delivery Company.
