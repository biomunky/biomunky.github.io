Long time Emacs user
Been using vim because it's installed on every machine I touch. 
Watched a video someone linked at work, liked the speed and some of the features, wanted to try something different.
Figured I would copy aspects of the guys vim config ... how hard could it be

This went two ways:
 * Using lua and neovim
 * using [AstroNvim](https://astronvim.com/)

At some point I will write this up, for the moment the gist is

### don't do this
The lua config for neovim worked well on a couple of machines, albeit with a bit of faff.

### do this
On my work machine I gave [AstroNvim](https://astronvim.com) and shot, it worked out of the box and is considerably easier to tinker with, much like spacemacs. Based on how much time I have wasted on editor config I would suggest going the Astro route.
